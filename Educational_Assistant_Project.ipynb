        "# **Educational Assistant Project: Leveraging Large Language Models in Education**\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Project Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Title**: Empowering Education in the Digital Age\n",
        "### **Authors**: Bibi Nur Muhamad, Elijah Kulpinski, Fernando Vargas\n",
        "### **Institution**: University of Wisconsin - Parkside, Kenosha WI USA\n",

        "#### **Abstract**\n",
        "This project, titled \"Empowering Education in the Digital Age,\" is a pioneering initiative aimed at enhancing the learning experience in computer science education through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to develop an educational assistant that utilizes advanced AI techniques to provide personalized learning experiences, thereby improving student engagement and critical thinking skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Objective**\n",
        "The primary objective of this project is to explore the potential of LLMs in transforming educational methodologies. By integrating these models into educational content, we aim to create an interactive, adaptive learning environment that caters to the unique needs and learning styles of each student.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Methodology**\n",
        "The project encompasses a series of steps, beginning with the conversion of textbook content from PDF to XML format, followed by OCR processing of textbook datasets. We then transform Markdown content into XML for structured data representation. A significant part of our project involves generating conversation trees to simulate educational dialogues, which are vital for training our LLM. The conversation outputs in JSONL format are then converted to JSON for compatibility with various tools and platforms. The culmination of our project is the fine-tuning of the Mistral OpenOrca model in Google Colab, specifically tailored to our educational context.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Expected Outcomes**\n",
        "We anticipate that the integration of LLMs into educational content will result in a more engaging and effective learning experience. This project aims to demonstrate how AI can be used to create adaptive learning materials that respond to the needs of individual learners, thereby enhancing the overall quality of education.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Scope of This Notebook**\n",

        "**Author**: Elijah Kulpinski <br>\n",

        "**Version**: 2.0.1 <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## Description\n",
        "\n",
        "This Python script is designed to generate conversation trees for educational purposes, focusing on topics in computer science and education. The script operates asynchronously, enabling parallel generation of multiple conversation trees. Each tree is derived from a paragraph extracted from a collection of textbook content. The primary objective is to foster critical thinking and a deeper understanding of the subject matter in students. The trees simulate educational dialogues, serving as a crucial part of the data preparation stage for training language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Asynchronous Processing:** The script generates multiple conversation trees simultaneously, optimizing resource usage and reducing processing time. This feature is particularly important when dealing with a large number of paragraphs, ensuring scalability and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Contextual Tree Generation:** Each conversation tree is built incrementally, rooted in a specific paragraph from a textbook. This approach guarantees that each tree is contextually relevant and coherent, directly tied to the educational content.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Branching Logic:** The script employs a dynamic branching logic to expand conversations. This logic takes into account the content and educational goals of each paragraph, generating conversations that are not only relevant but also pedagogically sound.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Quality Control:** The script includes mechanisms for automated quality checks, ensuring consistency and coherence in the generated conversations. Manual oversight is also incorporated for educational relevance, allowing for fine-tuning and adjustments to align with specific teaching objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **API Rate Limit Management:** The script is designed to monitor and manage API usage efficiently, staying within the constraints of rate limits. This ensures smooth operation and minimizes the risk of service interruptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "Before running the script, ensure all dependencies are installed and that the necessary API keys are set up. The script can be executed with Python 3.x. Each run processes a set of paragraphs from the XML file, generating a unique conversation tree for each paragraph. The output is a set of JSONL files, each representing a conversation tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Note\n",
        "\n",
        "Access to the OpenAI API is required for this script. It is crucial to adhere to the API's rate limits and usage guidelines. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and API quota to use this script effectively. The script is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing users to modify parameters such as the number of paragraphs processed and the depth of conversation trees, to suit different requirements and constraints."

        "## Description\n",
        "\n",
        "This script, updated to version 2.1.0, refines the conversation tree generation process for educational dialogues. Enhancements include deduplication logic, improved parsing and error handling, detailed quality check logging, and various other refinements to ensure high-quality, diverse datasets for LLM fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Asynchronous Processing:** Manages concurrent tasks to efficiently generate conversation trees.\n",
        "- **Deduplication:** Prevents the creation of duplicate conversation entries.\n",
        "- **Enhanced Parsing:** Robust handling of API responses to ensure valid JSON formatting.\n",
        "- **Detailed Quality Check Feedback:** Provides specific reasons for quality check failures to aid in debugging.\n",
        "- **Improved Backoff Mechanism:** Strategically retries after recoverable errors, including rate limits.\n",
        "- **Finer-Grained Error Handling:** Allows precise tracking of issues at the paragraph level.\n",
        "- **Enhanced Logging:** Offers comprehensive logging for better traceability and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Version History\n",
        "\n",
        "- **2.1.1:** Moved conversation quality check to using OpenAI's API for consistency, quality, and performance.\n",
        "- **2.1.0:** Added deduplication, enhanced parsing logic, more advanced quality check NLP checks, and improved error handling.\n",
        "- **2.0.0:** Introduced a granular rating system, sophisticated rehaul of the branching logic, automated data quality checks, and cost-efficient API utilization strategies.\n",
        "- **1.3.0:** Implemented log file generation and console output for improved monitoring and debugging. Conducted testing with 'output-snippet.xml' and processed the resulting 'conversation_trees.jsonl' file for data integrity.\n",
        "- **1.2.0:** Introduced dual-branching logic to simulate 'good' and 'bad' educational responses, creating a dynamic dataset with varied teaching methodologies.\n",
        "- **1.1.0:** Transitioned from synchronous to asynchronous processing, allowing for parallel generation of conversation trees and optimizing resource usage. Time tracking added to monitor task times for testing.\n",
        "- **1.0.0:** Initial release. Generated simple, linear conversation trees in a synchronous manner. Basic API rate limit management and conversation context derived directly from textbook content.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "Run with Python 3.x, ensuring all dependencies from 'requirements.txt' are installed and API keys are set in '.env'. The script processes paragraphs from an XML file and outputs conversation trees to a '.jsonl' file.\n"
