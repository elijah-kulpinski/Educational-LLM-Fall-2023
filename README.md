# Educational-LLM-Fall-2023

## Abstract
This proposal seeks to address the challenges posed by traditional educational tools, which often fall short in meeting the evolving needs of modern students in the digital age. Our research focuses on enhancing student critical thinking and engagement in computer science course education, encompassing discussions, quizzes, lectures, homework, and related activities. The core issue at hand is the limited accessibility and engagement associated with conventional educational resources within the computer science domain. In response to this challenge, we advocate for the application of modern language models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), as a valuable tool for teachers rather than a replacement. LLMs have the capacity to revolutionize computer science education by offering dynamic, interactive, and highly personalized learning experiences. Unlike traditional teaching methods, LLMs can be used by teachers to provide students with immediate and precise responses to their questions, creating an engaging learning environment. This innovative approach enables the implementation of one-on-one teaching, a level of personalization that has historically been unfeasible with non-LLM-based teaching solutions within the computer science curriculum. Our methodology includes the careful supervised fine-tuning of our LLM, ensuring domain-specificity and up-to-date knowledge within the field of computer science. Finetuned LLMs have the potential to significantly enhance student critical thinking and engagement by providing teachers with a tool to offer tailored support in discussions, quizzes, lectures, and homework. Teachers can employ LLMs to engage students in conversations, giving them questions tailored to their subject and providing hints as needed, while collecting the resulting interactions. Our teamâ€™s commitment lies in adapting educational content to cater to the unique needs and preferences of individual computer science learners, thus enhancing the accessibility and engagement of education in the digital  ge and promoting critical thinking in the context of computer science education.
