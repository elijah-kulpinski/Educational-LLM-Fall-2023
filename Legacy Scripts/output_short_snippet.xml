                <paragraph><![CDATA[I am glad that my training in writing and speaking were conducted separately. In
                    the case of writing, I learned how to weigh the selection of individual words and to
                    read many words in sequence before passing judgement over whether they were
                    true, false or even sensible. Learning to write as a distinct art gave me a tolerance
                    for ambiguity in expression. Very few things make sense immediately in writing,
                    unless you have previously seen what has been written. To be sure, this often hap-
                    pens, because authors repeat themselves and each other. This is why ‘skimming’
                    and ‘scanning’ a text is often a successful substitute for properly ‘reading’ it.
                    However, repetition is usually considered to be a vice—not a virtue—of writing. (It
                    may even count as ‘self-plagiarism’.) Writing is supposed to express a unique
                    thought in each sentence, and ‘reading’ is the art of dealing with a text as if that
                    supposition were true. The virtues of speaking are very different. Repetition is toler-
                    ated—and even encouraged—to keep an idea in the forefront of the audience’s
                    mind. This point was first made clear to me when I was taught to recite various
                    speeches, poems and songs as a student of Jesuit schooling. Such works include
                    ‘motifs’, ‘refrains’ and ‘choruses’ precisely because they have been written to be
                    performed in voice. It is against this backdrop that so much of twentieth-century
                    music and poetry—and academic writing, one might add—is said to be ‘difficult’.
                    These compositions typically lack the performance-oriented features of more clas-
                    sically composed works. For example, if the sequence of notes in a piano-based
                    musical score is too complicated, then the pianist cannot simply do it from memory
                    but must perform at a level below her normal technical expertise, as she is forced to
                    read the notes while playing.]]>

                <paragraph><![CDATA[The journey to teacher expertise is clearly not a given just because you have, at
                    one time, been taught. Action and activity – yours and those training you – drive
                    that journey. Yet it would be foolish to ignore or suppress what you already think
                    and believe about teaching. Knowledge you acquire through training isn’t written
                    on a blank slate. At times, this knowledge will support the construction of your
                    image of an ideal teacher. At others, you might be challenged to re-evaluate this
                    image based on new understanding or fresh experience. Bear that in mind, as we
                    look at ways to develop knowledge here.]]>
